# Graphic processing software
The program allows transforming graphics using algorithms created for this purpose. The program allows such operations as:
- changing the image to gray,
- giving a sepia effect,
- binarization of an image,
- returning the degree of similarity of two images
- displaying the histogram of the photo
- thresholding
- elimination of tails
By default, the image "lena.jpg" is used in the program.
